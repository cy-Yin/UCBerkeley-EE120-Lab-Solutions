This repository contains the lab 1~6 of the course "Signals and Systems" in the UC Berkeley EE120 in the semester of fall 2019.

One can find the course website [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee120/fa19/).

All the materials and solutions of Lab 1~3 and 5,6 can be found in the corresponding folders. The solutions of Lab 4 are not completely included since the folder size is too big. One can download the whole Lab 4 folder [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee120/fa19/labs/lab4/lab4.zip), which contains several files `data.MOV` and `data.npy` that are too big to be uploaded to the GitHub repository.
